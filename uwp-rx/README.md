# UWP example of Reactive Extensions for .NET (Rx.NET)

An example code that demonstrates the use of Rx.NET together with Kentico Cloud in an [Universal Windows App](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/) (UWP).

## How to run the code

Your Visual Studio 2017 installation should have the UWP component installed. The target version of Windows 10 is 10586 (1511, the "November update"), the minimal version is 10240 (1507, the initial version of Windows 10).

Once opened in Visual Studio, run the sample with F5. In the top text box, enter a code name of any taxonomy term in the "personas" taxonomy group of the sample Dancing Goat project and **hit Tab** (to move focus away from the textbox). Without pressing Tab, the UWP text box wouldn't emit its [PropertyChanged](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.componentmodel.inotifypropertychanged.propertychanged?f1url=https%3A%2F%2Fmsdn.microsoft.com%2Fquery%2Fdev15.query%3FappId%3DDev15IDEF1%26l%3DEN-US%26k%3Dk(System.ComponentModel.INotifyPropertyChanged.PropertyChanged)%3Bk(TargetFrameworkMoniker-.NETCore%2CVersion%3Dv5.0)%3Bk(DevLang-csharp)%26rd%3Dtrue&view=netcore-1.1) event.
